Capture the complete text content from the active web page where the user is browsing (not just the input field), including all visible text, headings, paragraphs, and relevant contextual information. Format this page context in a structured way that's easily recognizable by the Gemini model. Send this comprehensive page context data to the FlowWrite backend along with the user's current input field content to enable more contextually relevant AI writing suggestions. Implement proper error handling for cases where page content cannot be accessed or is too large to transmit efficiently.
